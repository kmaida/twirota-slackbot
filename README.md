# Twirota

Twirota is a simple **Twi**tter **rota**tion concierge Slackbot I wrote for internal team use at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com). The inspiration was derived from my time working at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and using Auth0's extremely useful concierge Slackbot.

## Usage

* `@twirota assign [@user]` assigns someone to the Twitter rotation
* `@twirota clear` removes the current assignment
* `@twirota who` reports the name of the currently assigned concierge
* `@twirota help` shows the list of available commands
* `@twirota [some other message]` sends a direct message to the concierge, notifying them of your message that needs attention
